# Integration and Verification Plan

This document outlines the plan for integrating the refactored ModelSelector components and verifying that functionality remains consistent.

## Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Component Integration
1. **Create Main Component**
   - Implement ModelSelector.tsx using the skeleton structure
   - Integrate state management hook
   - Connect screen navigation
   - Add escape key handling

2. **Integrate Screen Components**
   - Implement each screen component according to specifications
   - Connect state and handlers to each screen
   - Ensure consistent styling and layout
   - Verify navigation between screens

3. **Connect Utility Functions**
   - Integrate model fetching utilities
   - Connect connection testing utilities
   - Implement formatting and helper functions
   - Verify error handling and fallback strategies

### Phase 2: State Management Integration
1. **Hook Implementation**
   - Complete useModelSelectorState hook implementation
   - Connect all state variables and handlers
   - Implement useEffect hooks for side effects
   - Verify initial state setup

2. **Context Integration (if needed)**
   - Create ModelSelector.context.tsx if central state is needed
   - Connect context to main component and screens
   - Verify proper state propagation

### Phase 3: Navigation Integration
1. **Screen Navigation Hook**
   - Implement useScreenNavigation hook
   - Connect screen stack management
   - Verify navigation between all screens
   - Test back navigation functionality

2. **Input Handling**
   - Connect useInput handlers for keyboard navigation
   - Implement form field navigation
   - Verify escape key handling
   - Test special key combinations

## Verification Strategy

### Functional Verification
1. **Provider Selection Flow**
   - Test all provider selection options
   - Verify Anthropic sub-menu functionality
   - Check provider-specific base URL handling

2. **Model Configuration**
   - Test automatic model discovery
   - Verify manual model input
   - Check model parameter configuration
   - Test context length selection

3. **API Integration**
   - Verify API key handling and storage
   - Test connection testing functionality
   - Check error handling for various scenarios
   - Validate successful configuration saving

4. **Navigation**
   - Test forward navigation through all screens
   - Verify back navigation at each step
   - Check escape key functionality
   - Test completion and cancellation flows

### Compatibility Verification
1. **Existing Functionality**
   - Ensure all existing provider support remains
   - Verify model fetching for all providers
   - Check connection testing for all provider types
   - Confirm configuration saving and loading

2. **Edge Cases**
   - Test with invalid API keys
   - Verify behavior with network errors
   - Check handling of unsupported models
   - Test retry mechanisms

3. **Performance**
   - Verify no performance degradation
   - Check loading states and indicators
   - Confirm responsive UI during operations

### Testing Approach

#### Unit Testing
1. **Hook Testing**
   - Test useModelSelectorState with various initial conditions
   - Verify state updates and side effects
   - Check error handling in hooks

2. **Utility Function Testing**
   - Test formatting functions with various inputs
   - Verify model sorting and filtering
   - Check validation functions

3. **Component Testing**
   - Test individual screen components with mock data
   - Verify rendering with different state values
   - Check event handling

#### Integration Testing
1. **Flow Testing**
   - Test complete provider setup flows
   - Verify model selection and configuration
   - Check connection testing and confirmation

2. **State Integration**
   - Test state persistence across screens
   - Verify state updates from user actions
   - Check reset behavior when needed

#### Manual Testing
1. **User Experience**
   - Verify consistent styling and layout
   - Check keyboard navigation
   - Test all interactive elements
   - Confirm help text and instructions

2. **Error Scenarios**
   - Test with various error conditions
   - Verify user-friendly error messages
   - Check recovery from errors

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Are Found
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Document the specific issue
   - Identify the affected component or function
   - Determine if it's a regression or new issue

2. **Resolution Approaches**
   - Fix the specific issue if straightforward
   - Revert individual components if needed
   - Fall back to original implementation if necessary

3. **Communication**
   - Notify stakeholders of any issues
   - Provide timeline for resolution
   - Update documentation as needed
