## Guidelines

- each time you finish all tasks(relevent to code edit), run `bun typecheck` to find ts errors.
- you don't need to run 
- always use powershell format if you want to run commands. for example, use ';' instead of '&&' if you want to run multiple commands in one time. 
- use rg(ripgrep) instead of grep
